66 days of data challenge

Heard about this #66days_of_Data_Science challenge from a guy named Ken Jee in his YouTube channel.
Sounds exciting and I am interested in learning about Data science with handson from various sources.
I'm gonna be blogging about my progress in here for the purposes of accountability and to keep myself motivated.
Man I hope this works out!

Day 1(2/3/21) : Fortunately I knew some basics of Python beforehand. So I was able to go through with a tutorial on Numpy on Youtube and work on the same!.

Day 2(3/3/21) : Went through a tutorial on Pandas on YT and worked on the same.

Thanks.
